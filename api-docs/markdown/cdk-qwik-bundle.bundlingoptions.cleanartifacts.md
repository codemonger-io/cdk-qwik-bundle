Whether "dist" and "server" folders are deleted before building.

**Signature:**

```typescript
readonly cleanArtifacts?: boolean;
```

## Remarks

"dist" and "server" may contain artifacts from a previous build with a different configuration. This option will prevent the bundle from accidentally including different version.
